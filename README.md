# Grain-128AEADv2

> [!WARNING]
> Projet still under developpement

## Projet's aim
Provide an efficient implementation of the *grain-128AEADv2* algorithm without Rust standard library, allowing a better portability for embeded platforms. The efficiency of the implementation is focused on both memory and CPU, leading to trade-off between these two variables.

## TODO
- Implement Rust Crypto traits for Grain
- Improve unit tests
- Improve/crate doc
